direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use 

the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 

damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 

obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to 

indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 

accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
